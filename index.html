            According to Famous People Lessons, "Sir Timothy Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who invented the World Wide Web. He received a knighthood from the British Queen for his efforts (so he is called 'Sir'). He is director of W3C, which looks after the Web's development. A leading British newspaper ranked him as the world's greatest living genius."
